Stopwatch Web Application

In this task, I will build a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing and resetting the stopwatch, the users will be able to accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, I will try to create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
